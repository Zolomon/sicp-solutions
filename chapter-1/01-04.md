```
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))```

The if statement is evaluated first which checks if b > 0 and 
returns the "+" operator if that is the case, otherwise the 
"-" operator is returned. The returned operator is then evaluated 
with the operands evaluated before their values are substituted 
for their placeholder positions in the operators code.
