(define (p) (p))

(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0)
      0
      y))

(test 0 (p))

If applicative-order evaluation is used, these are the steps that will be performed during "eval/apply":

* [1] Eval the subexpressions in any order.
* [2] Apply the value of the first subexpression to the values of all the other subexpressions.

* [1] If the procedure to apply is a *primitive*, just do it.
* [2] If the procedure is a *compound procedure*, **evaluate** the body of the procedure with each formal parameter replaced by the corresponding actual argument expression value.


(test 0 (p))

(test 0 (p))

...

(test 0 (p))

So we have an endless recursion.
